Wow
Woah, woah, woah

My love is like a cannonball
I'm takin' aim and you're gonna fall
Well don't hide or try to get away
You know the rules and you're gonna play

And we go one, two, three, four
When midnight comes, I'll be at your door
Five, six, seven, eight
Woah, oh, I just can't wait

I'm gonna bang bang you
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby
Bang bang you
I got you in the heart, you're gonna be mine, yeah, ooh

Hands up, reach for the sky
I'll treat you good, 'cause I'm a bad guy
If love's a crime I've got a hundred schemes
I'll be the villain in your book of dreams

And we go one, two, three, four
When midnight comes, I'll be at your door
Five, six, seven, eight
Woah, woah, I just can't wait

I'm gonna bang bang you
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby
Bang bang you
I've got you in the heart, you're gonna be mine, yeah

You know what I'm talking about

Ooh, come on!

Listen, one, two, three, four
When midnight comes, I'll be at your door
Five, six, seven, eight
Woah, woah, I just can't wait

I'm gonna bang bang you
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby
Bang bang you
Woah, I got you in the heart, you're gonna be mine

Bang bang you, woah
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby
Bang bang you
I got you in the heart, you're gonna be mine, yeah

Bang bang you, ow

Bang bang you, woah

Bang bang you, woah
